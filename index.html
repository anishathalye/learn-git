<br>

If you have questions, feel free to interrupt me at any time!

Slides available online at https://go.hackmit.org/git

???

* If you have a question, there are probably others who have the same question
as you

* If the presentation is going too fast or slow, tell me

---

# Prereqs

* Know Unix command line basics
    * Using a shell, `ls`, `cd`, etc.

* Check if you have Git installed
    * Run `git --version`

* Download using a package manager (Homebrew, APT, etc.)
    * Or get it from https://git-scm.com/download
    * Windows users: installer also gives you Git BASH

???

* If you don't have it installed, download it now

---

# Why use a version control system (VCS)?

* Keep track of changes in code

* Enable good local workflows

* Enable collaboration

---

# Keeping version history without a VCS

.center[
    ![](manual-vcs-history.png)
]

???

* Keep history with copies of project directory

* How many people have done this before?

---

# Branching without a VCS

.center[
    ![](manual-vcs-branching.png)
]

???

* Make branches with copies of project directory

* How many people have done this before?

---

# Collaborating without a VCS

.center[
    ![](manual-vcs-collaborating.png)
]

???

* Collaborate by sending email attachments
    * Most painful

* How many people have done this before?

---

# Why Git?

* Popular
    * Used for Linux kernel, Android, Bootstrap, Angular.js, D3, Meteor, Rails,
    React, ...

* Fast, simple, and robust

* Distributed

* Enables non-linear workflows

* GitHub
    * Social coding site
    * Lots of popular projects hosted here

???

* You're convinced that a manual workflow is painful
    * Want a tool to make everything nicer

* Git is simple and robust
    * Designed by Linus Torvalds
    * Simple implementation, fairly clean interface
    * Fast

* GitHub is a social coding site
    * Super popular, lots of big projects are there, lots more are migrating
    there

* There are other version control systems
    * Mercurial, SVN, ...
    * You can read about the differences online, there are lots of blog posts
    on this topic

---

# Teaching philosophy

* Can't teach Git in an hour
    * It's not just about using the git command-line tool, it's about learning
    good practices and learning how to collaborate with others

* Can learn the fundamentals in an hour
    * Figure out the rest by playing around with git and reading the
    documentation

* Learn implementation before interface

---

# Repository model

* Snapshots of state (files, directory structure)
    * "Commit"
    * In a way, like making a copy of the entire directory

* Store how commits are related to each other
    * Commit has "parents", revision(s) that preceded it
    * Directed acyclic graph

* References
    * Pointers to commits
    * Branches - mutable
    * Tags - immutable

---

# Repository model

.center[
    ![](history-graph.png)
]

???

* Does not track deltas like other VCSs

---

# Object model

* Surprisingly simple

* Content-addressed file system

.center[
    ![](object-model.png)
]

* Learn more: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Internals

---

# Learn Git

* Follow along with the slides
    * But this is just an introduction to some of the git subcommands
    * You'll have time to play with Git later, and we'll be around to help you

* Do all this in a new directory
    * Don't do this with an existing project (yet)

* Think about how command line operations affect the history DAG
    * If you know what you want to do, but don't know what command to run,
    search on Google or Stack Overflow

---

# Configuration

* Initial setup

```bash
git config --global user.name "Alyssa P. Hacker"
git config --global user.email hacker@hackmit.org
```

* Settings in `~/.gitconfig`

* Other useful bits

```bash
git config --global ui.color auto
git config --global alias.graph "log --graph --decorate --all"
```

* Getting help: `git help <subcommand>`
    * Like `git help config`
    * Run `git help` for a list for a list of commonly used commands

---

# Initializing a repository

```bash
git init
```

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /src/repo/.git/
```

---

# Initial commit

```bash
echo "blah" > blah.txt
git add :/
git status
```

```
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   blah.txt
```

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

```
[master (root-commit) bdf98f2] Initial commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 blah.txt
```

???

* Staging area

* What does "On branch master" mean?

---

# Making changes

```bash
echo "more stuff" >> blah.txt
git diff
```

```
diff --git i/blah.txt w/blah.txt
index 907b308..82471e8 100644
--- i/blah.txt
+++ w/blah.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 blah
+more stuff
```

---

```bash
git add :/ && git commit -m "Add more stuff"
git graph
```

```

* commit bdf98f24631baa22063d01ad7e8bb8a7424c736a
  Author: Anish Athalye <me@anishathalye.com>
  Date:   Thu Sep 10 20:24:56 2015 -0400

      Initial commit
```

* `git graph` is the single most important command (alias) to remember
    * It will be super helpful in understanding what is going on
    * Use it often

???

* Commit messages

* Commit hashes

* Branches / HEAD

* Graph / parents

---

# Branching and Merging

* Used to work on different topics concurrently (among other stuff)

```bash
git checkout -b optimization
# do stuff, editing files and making commits
git checkout master
# do some work on master, editing files and making commits

# when ready to merge in changes from optimization:
git merge optimization
```

* Dealing with merge conflicts

---

# Remotes

* Interact with other Git repositories

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame
```

* Push changes

```bash
git push origin master
```

* Fetch changes

```bash
git fetch
```

* Fetch changes and merge

```bash
git pull
```

---

# Cloning

* Getting code from a remote

```bash
git clone https://github.com/git/git
```

???

* Try it

---

# Organizing version history

* Best way to learn how to organize version history and have good workflows?
    * See how other people do it!
    * https://github.com/git/git

* Things can get pretty complicated - visualize as a graph!

---

# Beyond the basics

* Customizing Git
    * `~/.gitconfig`
    * See https://go.hackmit.org/gitconfig as an example

* Git status in your shell prompt

* Learning `git mergetool`
    * Nice tools for handling merge conflicts like Vimdiff

* Open-source workflows
    * Merging, rebasing, tagging

* Using GitHub
    * Issues, Pull Requests, Wiki, ...

---

# If something goes wrong

* `git reflog`
    * Read about it online

* Google / StackOverflow
    * Other people have probably had the same issue

---

# Resources

* `git help <subcommand>`

* https://git-scm.com/doc
    * Awesome resource, covers everything from basics to Git internals
    * **Highly recommended** that you read this at some point, at least
    chapters 1-4

* http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/
    * Really cool browser-based game

* https://go.hackmit.org/git
    * These slides

    * This stuff can be pretty confusing!

* Ideas
    * Make and switch between branches
        * Play the "Learn Git Branching" game
    * Interact with remotes
    * Clone code from GitHub, explore version history
        * https://github.com/git/git
    * Customize your `~/.gitconfig`
